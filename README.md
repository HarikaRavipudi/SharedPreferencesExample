# SharedPreferencesExample:blush:
Android provides many ways for storing the data.One of the way is SharedPreferences.
SharedPreferences are used to store the data, saved in the form of Key,Value pair.
In this Project I am using Count button which will increments count value by 1 at each time and reset button will reset the value.
Different colors are used and it also saves the color along with the count value.
Even we close the app the data will be saved and it will be loaded :thumbsup:
This is the overview of the project :thumbsup: 
SharedPreferences are prefered rather than onSaveInstanceState because even it is app is killed or reboot data doesn't change and persist across sessions.
