# SharedPreferencesExample:blush:
Android provides many ways for storing the data.One of the way is SharedPreferences.
SharedPreferences are used to store the data, saved in the form of Key,Value pair.
In this Project I am using Count button which will increments count value by 1 at each time and reset button will reset the value.
Different colors are used and it also saves the color along with the count value.
This is the overview of the project :thumbsup:
