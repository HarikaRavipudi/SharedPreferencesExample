# SharedPreferencesExample:blush:
Android provides many ways for storing the data.One of the way is SharedPreferences.
SharedPreferences are used to store the data, saved in the form of Key,Value pair.
In this Project I am using Count button which will increments count value by 1 at each time and reset button will reset the value.
Even we close the app the data will be saved and it will be loaded :thumbsup:
Different colors are used and it also saves the color.
